Someone has proposed to add the following feature to the SearchStream table:

   {{new_feature_desc}}

We have already loaded the table contents as Pandas DataFrames:

```python
import pandas as pd

{% for table_name in table_desc.keys() %}
{{table_name}} = pd.read_csv('{{table_name}}.csv')
{% endfor %}
```

Can you write the Python code to compute the feature above?
If not, simply answer "None".
If so, please directly write the Python code that adds the said feature as a new column {{target_table}} table, without any additional information.  You are free to use any Python packages available online.
Example (note that the actual answer in this particular example may not make sense):

```python
{{target_table}}["NewFeature"] = 0
```
